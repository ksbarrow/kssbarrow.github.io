## Biography

I am a NASA Hubble Postdoctoral Fellow at the Harvard University and Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In summer 2022 I will be transitioning to an assistant professor position at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  

I am mostly interested in modeling galaxy and star formation numerically as well as producing mock observations of the early Universe. I am also interested in orbital mechanics modeling for spacecraft missions in our solar system.

See my [CV](KSSBarrow-Public-CV-August 2021.pdf) and the [research page](research) for more about my academic history and a summary of some of my projects.

I grew up in various places in the US and in Jamaica, moving 13 times before graduating high school. I stayed put in Georgia for college and Atlanta became my adopted home town of 15 years.

In the San Fransisco area, you'd usually find me outdoors biking, hiking, surfing, and climbing in my free time. In Boston, I'm exploring and enjoying my first real winter in many, many years.
