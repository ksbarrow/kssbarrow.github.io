## Biography

I have been a Porat Postdoctoral Fellow at the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology at Stanford since September 2018. I am mostly interested in modeling galaxy and star formation numerically as well as producing mock observations of the early Universe. I am also interested in orbital mechanics modeling for spacecraft missions in our solar system.

See my [CV](KSSBarrow-Public-CV-August 2021.pdf) and the [research page](research) for more about my academic history and a summary of some of my projects.

I grew up in various places in the US and in Jamaica, moving 13 times before graduating high school. I stayed put in Georgia for college and Atlanta became my adopted home town of 15 years.

As a new resident of the Bay Area, I have fallen in love with the outdoors! You'll find me biking, hiking, surfing, and climbing in my free time.
